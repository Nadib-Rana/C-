#### **Topics to Learn:**
- **Introduction to C++**:
  - What is C++ and its history?
  - Differences between C++ and other programming languages (e.g., Python, Java).
  - Installing C++ development environment (IDE, compiler).

- **Basic Syntax and Structure**:
  - Structure of a C++ program (main function, braces, semicolons).
  - **Hello World** program.

- **Variables and Data Types**:
  - Basic data types: `int`, `float`, `char`, `double`, `bool`, `string`.
  - Typecasting and type conversions.
  - Constants (`const` keyword).

- **Input and Output**:
  - `cin` for user input and `cout` for output.
  - Basic formatting with `setw`, `setprecision`.

- **Basic Operators**:
  - Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.
  - Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
  - Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`.

#### **Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int number;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> number;
    cout << "You entered: " << number << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### **2. 🧑‍💻 Control Structures and Functions**

Learn how to manage program flow with **conditionals** and **loops**, and introduce yourself to **functions** for modular programming.

#### **Topics to Learn:**
- **Conditionals**:
  - `if`, `else if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.
  
- **Loops**:
  - `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

- **Functions**:
  - Function declaration, definition, and calling.
  - Parameters (pass by value/reference).
  - Return types.

- **Basic Debugging**:
  - Understanding common errors (syntax, runtime).
  - Using `cin.fail()` for error handling.

#### **Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void greet(string name) {
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << endl;
}

int main() {
    string name;
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    cin >> name;
    greet(name);
    return 0;
}
```

### **3. 💡 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

Master the concept of **classes** and **objects**, which is the core of C++ programming. Learn the principles of **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.

#### **Topics to Learn:**
- **Classes and Objects**:
  - Define classes and create objects.
  - Access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`).

- **Constructors and Destructors**:
  - Constructor overloading.
  - Destructor for cleanup.

- **Encapsulation**:
  - Getter and setter functions.

- **Inheritance**:
  - Base and derived classes.
  - `public`, `protected`, `private` inheritance.

- **Polymorphism**:
  - Function overloading.
  - Function overriding and virtual functions.

#### **Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    void speak() { cout << "Animal speaks!" << endl; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() { cout << "Dog barks!" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Dog dog;
    dog.speak();  // Outputs: Dog barks!
    return 0;
}
```

### **4. 📚 Intermediate Level: Advanced Features and STL (Standard Template Library)**

Now that you've mastered the basics, it's time to dive into more powerful features like **pointers**, **dynamic memory allocation**, and the **Standard Template Library**.

#### **Topics to Learn:**
- **Pointers and References**:
  - Declaring and using pointers.
  - Memory management (`new`, `delete`).
  - Null pointers and references.

- **Dynamic Memory**:
  - `new` and `delete` operators.
  - Memory leaks and avoiding them.

- **STL (Standard Template Library)**:
  - Containers: `vector`, `list`, `deque`, `map`, `set`, etc.
  - Iterators: How to traverse containers.
  - Algorithms: Sorting, searching, etc.

- **Exception Handling**:
  - `try`, `catch`, `throw` for managing runtime errors.

#### **Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for (int num : numbers) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### **5. 🔧 Advanced Level: Optimization, Multithreading, and Advanced Topics**

At this stage, you'll learn about optimizing your code and handling more complex topics like **multithreading**, **smart pointers**, and **move semantics**.

#### **Topics to Learn:**
- **Move Semantics**:
  - Rvalue references (`&&`) and move constructors.
  - Optimizing code with **std::move**.

- **Smart Pointers**:
  - **std::unique_ptr**, **std::shared_ptr**, and **std::weak_ptr**.

- **Multithreading and Concurrency**:
  - Using `std::thread` to create threads.
  - Synchronization with **mutexes** and **locks**.

#include <thread>
using namespace std;

void printMessage() {
    cout << "Hello from thread!" << endl;
}

int main() {
    thread t(printMessage);
    t.join();  // Wait for the thread to finish
    return 0;
}
```

template <typename T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    cout << add(5, 3) << endl;  // Outputs: 8
    cout << add(3.5, 2.2) << endl;  // Outputs: 5.7
    return 0;
}
```
